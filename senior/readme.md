# What is a senior software engineer?

The following description is taken from Stackoverflow.com.

When I hear “Senior Developer” I think of someone who has mastered programming. I think of a person who can design, code and test a 
system. They can talk to system architecture or component design. They understand and use design patterns. This person can anticipate the 
performance bottlenecks, but knows not to pre-optimize. This person will leverage asynchronous programming, queuing, caching, logging, security and 
persistence when appropriate. When asked they can give a detail explanation of their choice and the pros and cons. In most cases they have mastered 
object oriented programming and design, this not an absolute other languages such as Javascript, F#, Scheme are powerful and are not object 
oriented. They are adept in risk management and most important of all they can communicate the before mentioned to their peers (Stackoverflow, 
2014).
