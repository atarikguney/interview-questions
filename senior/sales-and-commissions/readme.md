# Sales and Commissions

You have been asked to design a system a door-to-door sales company. The company sells cable, Internet, and telephone products. The system will keep track of customers, sales that are made, and commissions.

Within the company, there are multiple offices across the United States. Each office has a unique list of products they sell. While it is possible for the same product to be sold in multiple offices, the price may differ for the same product from one office to the next.
Each office also contains one or more sales teams. A sales team consists of multiple sales representatives, and a sales team leader. The sales representatives receive a commission based on each product sold, as well as the sales team leader.

Each office belongs to an area. An area is a group of offices. An area contains an area manager. The area manager receives a commission for each sale that is made under him/her.

Each area belongs to a region. A region is a group of areas. A region contains a regional manager. The regional manager receives a commission for each sale that is made under him/her.

Commissions are calculated biweekly. Sales reps are paid a tiered commission, based on how many sales they made during that two-week period. The commission tiers are currently as follows, although, they may change later one:

1.	0-10 products sold: 35% commission
2.	11-20 products sold: 45% commission
3.	21+ products sold: 55% commission

The sales team leader, the area manager, and the regional manager each currently receive $5.00 for each sale. This may change at a later date.

Ensure the system is able to keep track of the following items:

- Regions and Regional Managers
- Areas and Area Managers
- Sales Teams, Sales Reps, and Sales Team Managers
- Product Lists, Products, and product prices
- Commission tiers, and commissions for each role
- Customers, Orders, and Products sold, as well as who sold each product
